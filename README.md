# Full Stack Trivia Project

This project ia a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game.

This project will provide these functionality below:

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category. 

## Tasks

Start by reading the READMEs in:

1. [`./frontend/`](./frontend/README.md)
2. [`./backend/`](./backend/README.md)

We recommend following the instructions in those files in order. 


### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains Flask and SQLAlchemy server in app.py we define the endpoints and reference models.py for DB and SQLAlchemy setup. 

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.

[View the README.md within ./frontend for more details.](./frontend/README.md)
